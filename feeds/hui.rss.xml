It is a report of our New Idea to estimate the cost of adapting a running system by measure the system's &lt;strong&gt;diversity&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a measurement borrowed from ecology, using the famous Shannon Index. This is a joint work between SINTEF and TCD, under the FP7-FET project, DIVERSIFY. This time, the paper is accepted with quite positive reviews (two strong accepts and a weak accept), which can be regarded as a good start for our research this this new and interesting direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">hui</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2015 20:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:songhui.github.io,2015-01-20:posts/2015/01/20/icsenier14/</guid><category>new paper</category><category>icse</category><category>diversify</category></item><item><title>Demo paper accepted at SASO 2014</title><link>http://songhui.github.io/posts/2014/07/28/saso/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A short paper, &lt;em&gt;Dynamic Adaptation of the Traffic Management System CARDEMO&lt;/em&gt;, has been accepted at the demo track of the Eighth IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO 2014).

&lt;p&gt;The paper presented our attempt to apply SMT constraint solving on dynamic system adaptation planning, in the cloud computing domain. We provide a text-based language based on MOF and OCL to support the specification of adaptation policies, and provide a model transformation engine to transform these policies into an SMT problem. Finally, we use SMT solver to compute new state to satisfy as many adaptation constraints as possible. This new state is the adaptation result.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">hui</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2014 13:58:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:songhui.github.io,2014-07-27:posts/2014/07/27/models14/</guid><category>new paper</category><category>models</category></item><item><title>Ran the second leg of Holmenkollstafetten relay race</title><link>http://songhui.github.io/posts/2014/05/23/holmenkollstafetten/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race#Competitions"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, Holmenkollstafetten is the biggest relay race in the world. This year, it is said that there were almost 40k people running around the &lt;a href="http://www.holmenkollstafetten.no/index.php/loypekart.html"&gt;around the city of Oslo&lt;/a&gt;. It was an interesting experience to be one of these people. Well, I guess this was my first contribution to SINTEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually worried a bit before about whether I could finish the 1100 meters, a uphill slope with a 50-meters vertical drop. That was almost like climbing 15 floors, running (there are even some legs much worse than this one: such as 1700 meters with 100 meter drop). So, it was quite a surprise to me to know that I was finally ranked 733 out of 1500 people running Leg 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">hui</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2014 23:53:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:songhui.github.io,2014-05-23:posts/2014/05/23/holmenkollstafetten/</guid><category>sintef</category></item><item><title>Homepage Established</title><link>http://songhui.github.io/posts/2014/04/12/established/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After being lazy for more than half a year, I finally decided to set-up a new homepage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now most of the standard content in a "researcher's" homepage are there. I know it is too boring at this stage, but at least I have something to put when they want a "homepage link". Hopefully this webpage will live longer than any of my old ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">hui</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2014 14:04:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:songhui.github.io,2014-04-12:posts/2014/04/12/established/</guid><category>website</category></item></channel></rss>
