This year, it is said that there were almost 40k people running around the (around the city of Oslo)[http://www.holmenkollstafetten.no/index.php/loypekart.html]. It was an interesting experience to be one of these people. Well, I guess this was my first contribution to SINTEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually worried a bit before about whether I could finish the 1100 meters, a uphill slope with a 50-meters vertical drop. That was almost like climbing 15 floors, running (there are even some legs much worse than this one: such as 1700 meters with 100 meter drop). So, it was quite a surprise to me to know that I was finally ranked 733 out of 1500 people running Leg 2.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sintef"></category></entry><entry><title>Homepage Established</title><link href="http://songhui.github.io/posts/2014/04/12/established/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-12T14:04:00+02:00</updated><author><name>hui</name></author><id>tag:songhui.github.io,2014-04-12:posts/2014/04/12/established/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After being lazy for more than half a year, I finally decided to set-up a new homepage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now most of the standard content in a "researcher's" homepage are there. I know it is too boring at this stage, but at least I have something to put when they want a "homepage link". Hopefully this webpage will live longer than any of my old ones.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="website"></category></entry></feed>
