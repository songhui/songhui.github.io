A short paper, _Dynamic Adaptation of the Traffic Management System CARDEMO_, has been accepted at the demo track of the Eighth IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO 2014). The paper reports our experiment to apply the constraint-based adaptation approach on a Traffic Management System. It is a joint work between TCD and UCD.
