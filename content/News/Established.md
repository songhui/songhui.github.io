title: Homepage Established
slug: established
tags: website

After being lazy for more than half a year, I finally decided to set-up a new homepage. 

Now most of the standard content in a "researcher's" homepage are there. I know it is too boring at this stage, but at least I have something to put when they want a "homepage link". Hopefully this webpage will live longer than any of my old ones.
