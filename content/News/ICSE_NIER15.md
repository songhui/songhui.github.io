A DIVERSIFY paper titled _On Architectural Diversity of Dynamic Adaptive Systems_ is accepted by the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track of ICSE 2015. It is a report of our New Idea to estimate the cost of adapting a running system by measure the system's __diversity__, which is a measurement borrowed from ecology, using the famous Shannon Index. This is a joint work between SINTEF and TCD, under the FP7-FET project, DIVERSIFY. This time, the paper is accepted with quite positive reviews (two strong accepts and a weak accept), which can be regarded as a good start for our research this this new and interesting direction.
