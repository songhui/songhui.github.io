title: Ran the second leg of Holmenkollstafetten relay race

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race#Competitions), Holmenkollstafetten is the biggest relay race in the world. This year, it is said that there were almost 40k people running around the [around the city of Oslo](http://www.holmenkollstafetten.no/index.php/loypekart.html). It was an interesting experience to be one of these people. Well, I guess this was my first contribution to SINTEF.

I was actually worried a bit before about whether I could finish the 1100 meters, a uphill slope with a 50-meters vertical drop. That was almost like climbing 15 floors, running (there are even some legs much worse than this one: such as 1700 meters with 100 meter drop). So, it was quite a surprise to me to know that I was finally ranked 733 out of 1500 people running Leg 2.
