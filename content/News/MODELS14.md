Our paper, _Modelling Adaptation Policies as Domain-Specific Constraints_, has been accepted by ACM/IEEE 17th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2014).

The paper presented our attempt to apply SMT constraint solving on dynamic system adaptation planning, in the cloud computing domain. We provide a text-based language based on MOF and OCL to support the specification of adaptation policies, and provide a model transformation engine to transform these policies into an SMT problem. Finally, we use SMT solver to compute new state to satisfy as many adaptation constraints as possible. This new state is the adaptation result.
