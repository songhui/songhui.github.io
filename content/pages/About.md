title: About Me

I am a Research Scientist at SINTEF ICT, Oslo, Norway. My research is focused on leveraging model-driven approaches to support dynamic adaptive system at runtime. I investigate modelling techniques including language engineering, model transformation, and constraint solving, in order to support dynamic adaptation for cloud-based applications, middleware platforms, and cyber-physical systems.

I received my PhD in January 2012 from Peking University, China. In 2008, I worked as visiting student at NII, the National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan. Before joining SINTEF, I worked as a PostDoc Research Fellow with Lero, the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre, at Trinity College Dublin.
