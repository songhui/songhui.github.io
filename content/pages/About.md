title: About Me

I am Senior Researcher at SINTEF, Oslo, Norway. My research is focused on leveraging model-driven approaches to support dynamic adaptive systems at runtime. I investigate modelling techniques including language engineering, model transformation, and constraint solving, in order to support dynamic adaptation for cloud-based applications, middleware platforms, and Internet of Things.

I received my PhD in January 2012 from Peking University, China, and worked as visiting student for half a year in 2008 at NII, the National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan. Before joining SINTEF, I worked as a PostDoc Research Fellow from 2012 to 2013 with Lero, the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre, at Trinity College Dublin.

I am the project coordinator of the EU H2020 Project [ENACT](http://enact-project.eu).
