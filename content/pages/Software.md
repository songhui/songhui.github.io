- [CloudML](http://cloudml.org): A domain-specific modelling language for the provision, deployment, and runtime management of multi-cloud-based systems.
- [JQVT](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jqvt/): A QVT engine which targets the Java type system instead of EMF/Ecore. The JQVT generator generates Java code from a JQVT script, thus producing fast and adaptable transformations which can be embedded into a Java application more easily than traditional QVT scripts could.
