If anything just to help look over what this group is designed for and maybe help some people understand what the big idea is by talking about the details a little.</p>
<h2>The main goal</h2>
<p>I think the end goal, the main number one us to put on events for local furs that people want to go to. I know I can't make everyone happy but in my 7+ years of being a major player in the local furry community I often hear the same complaints over and over again when it comes to meets. For the 6 years I ran the boards I found that almost every complaint boiled down to one of the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>"It costs too much to go to amusement place X"</li>
<li>"I don't wanna eat at place X I just wanna hang out"</li>
<li>"<em>Someone</em> throw a house party cause I can't"</li>
<li>"The park is boring cause it's just everyone standing about"</li>
</ul>
<p>I know there are other complaints like "Too many kids, My friends aren't here, ect" I can't grant every wish but I think I can cover the above list. The idea is to put on small events, in rented areas where we can fit everyone in together and have something for everyone.</p>
<h3>Here is my "dream list";</h3>
<ul>
<li>Small event space at far off-strip casino like the suncoast</li>
<li>Whole event, one room, one day</li>
<li>LOW admission, sub 15$</li>
<li>A small dealers corner like 5 heads</li>
<li>Curtained off fur suit changing/decom area in the back</li>
<li>Video-game area in a corner</li>
<li>Tabletop game area right by video games</li>
<li>Lots of tables for art and chilling</li>
<li>A stage for some performances</li>
<li>A few panels, all held on said stage, all art and fur suit construction stuff... maybe some comedy or games.</li>
<li>I would offer a catered lunch (for a fee)</li>
<li>An ice cream social (again for fee)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things I wouldn't have;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Art show (I love them but I don't see the event being big enough to support one)</li>
<li>GOH. Just no. If you wanna come, perform, or promote please do but not on the dime of the attendees.</li>
<li>A "con book". I'd print out two massive poster with all details and events and slap it on two walls.</li>
<li>An external charity. I know it's the "thing to do" but the goal is to provide an event with minimal cost to the attendee. The altruism here is to contribute to the Furry Arts Community, not PETA/Shelters/ASPCA. We are not looking at making a profit either though, just covering the costs. Anything over will be put into a treasury for the next event.</li>
<li>Speaking of money, anyone getting paid. Right, <strong>no one</strong> affiliated with VFA gets paid, even a little. No reimbursements, no none of that. Money goes into FVA and <em>only</em> goes out to pay other entities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The bigger picture.</h2>
<p>The bigger picture is that FVA can be a respectable social group internally as well as the committee that puts on these events. I'm personally not sure how much I want to drive this but once things come together I think the steering committee can help out these plans. I think my only big thing here is that I want administrative transparency. I think everyone is getting old of the private administrative groups where no one knows what they are doing, or talking about, or what is going on. I want people to know what we do and what we are discussing.</p>
