</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've been pondering over my earlier membership quarry a lot since I posted about it. Honestly that's my biggest holdup from whipping sheets off of this plan and putting together the committee. What kind of group is this really?</p>
<h2>Public Club/Private Board</h2>
<p>This idea requires the least amount of work and on paper sounds like the best idea… yet I have watched it fail many times. All we do is find the steering committee that will run everything and then make everything that we run open to everyone. A public club with a fixed steering group.</p>
<p>VegasFurs.org worked like this for the 7 years that I ran the group and the simple fact is that this seems to create a large disconnect in the system. Usually the open attendees and members enjoy it but still feel a vague malcontent to their "overlords" running everything. Then the steering group becomes disenfranchised since they are the only ones putting the work into everything yet often end up resented for it. The few people who actually contribute become absorbed into the steering group and the fresh blood causes everything to revitalize up but over time the cycle continues.</p>
<h2>Original idea</h2>
<p>My original statement was that it's an art centric furry social club. We have open but listed and maintained membership with a board and driven purposeful goals. The question always was, does an open and free membership policy works with what we are trying to accomplish? <em>Maybe</em>; I already discussed this in the last post. No one became a club member to go to AC or PawFur, however for quarterly or monthly meets it could be useful to keep everything purpose driven. My problem is that what does the maintained yet open membership differ from the public club/private board method? In fact last year when I turned over
VF and it became VF.net, in spirit this is what it changed to. The board is locked off until you sign up, which anyone can, and then you are a part of the group and everyone can go as long as you are in the group or are a +1…</p>
<p>But how is this different from the First idea? So far in practice it isn't different at all. It's totally the same except you can sit down and count people. In the end most of the membership isn't personally vested in the forward moment of the community. Usually if the group's open membership is older there is less of this since (in my experience), the older the base group is the higher percentage of contributors there are. Youth adds a lot of energy and spontaneity to the group but they usually have far less resources and will to commit to actual work. Youth just wants to do <em>something</em> but Age tends to want to commit to stuff. In the end both are needed to keep a larger community flowing.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a way around this… to make the members more vested in the community by making a bigger deal about membership. However, the moment we start to put restrictions and goals and requirements to membership we stop being open membership and we become a fraternity.</p>
<h2>The Fraternity</h2>
<p>When talking to another friend about this idea the concept of a Furry Fraternity keeps coming up. You join by committing yourself to the group, both with a time and fiscal responsibility, then you become a part of this group which is a social group unto itself. This method could help us stay more focused while keeping the membership net wide and making sure we have growth and "fill in" in the board. If we have at least somewhat open membership then we make sure the group doesn't end up running around with massive blinders. It allows us to be more than just a convention committee, which I also think is important.</p>
<p>This is how V.A.G.I.N.A works and while it's a lot of administrative overhead it can indeed really blossom into amazing. However like V.A.G.I.N.A, Shriners, and other fraternities there is a lot of administrative overhead to it. You have to keep track of the group and keep it highly focused on it's goals and contributions to the community as a whole or it just devolves into a private clique. I already have close friends and I don't need to put in volunteer time and pay memberships to hang out with them.</p>
<h2>Refocusing</h2>
<p>VFA isn't about doing things easy, it's about doing things right, learning from my 7+ years of group management and putting together something that can breath life into this massive furry community. Whole VF.net is still running strong I'm seeing a lot of fall off, especially in the older brackets where there isn't any fill. I want to put together events that <em>everyone</em> wants to go to. I want to build a group that isn't exclusive, yet still fosters a level of closeness and community that other furry communities have, the kind that doesn't quarrel or fight with the rest of the furries in town but works with them to make things amazing… Oh and don't forget the art… it's kinda in the name… lets make something amazing.</p>
<p>Maybe some of this is a pipe dream. I probably can't have my cake and eat it too... but I'm gonna get close.</p>
