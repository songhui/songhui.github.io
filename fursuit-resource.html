    <h1 class="entry-title">FurSuiting</h1>
    <p>As cooler weather sets over Las Vegas and holidays approach the forums and groups in Las Vegas are teeming with anxious locals and traveling tourists. Fursuiting is on everyone's mind.</p>
<p>The first question asked always is, <em>"Where is the best place to suit in Las Vegas?"</em></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>at private events far away from downtown &amp; the strip</strong>.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain…</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> <em>2012-09-11 10:57</em></p>
<h1>Fursuiting in Las Vegas</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p><em>The staff of VFA are not lawyers. This is not legal advice.</em></p>
<p>Vegas Furry Arts feels that fursuiting is one of the amazing art forms in furry that are not only creative, expressive, but a pivotal part of furry as a whole. Fursuiters are easily the new face of furry as we as a community have crawled out of the darkness of internet rumors and CSI episodes. However Las Vegas, being the entertainment capital of the world<sup id="fnref:REALLY"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:REALLY" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, has unique challenges for fursuiters both local and visiting. This page is designed to be a living document to reference and help raise awareness of some of the issues that face fursuiters in Las Vegas as well as point out some dos and don'ts that apply to our fair city.</p>
<p>The biggest thing to remember is that fursuiting in public areas is considered <em>Street Performance</em> irregardless of intent and street performance is a <strong>restricted activity</strong> in Clark County<sup id="fnref:BOO"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:BOO" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>The legality of it</h2>
<p>Before February 2012 street performance on public land in Clark County was illegal, many people were brought up on various charges like trespassing and operating without license. This has been challenged under the first amendment and is currently relaxed <em>while lawmakers review and revise this policy</em>. Las Vegas law makers are currently trying to pass a bill stating you must have a license to be a costumer or street performer on the public streets of Clark County. Mayor Oscar Goodman has said on record he is against allowing street performers and costuming.<sup id="fnref:OSCAR"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:OSCAR" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<hr />
<p>According to the 2012 revisions costumed characters and performers on Freemont are required to<sup id="fnref:FREEMONTRULES"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:FREEMONTRULES" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>stay 20 feet away from doors, ATMs, fire lanes and crosswalks, and 10 feet away from retail kiosks and outdoor cafes.</li>
<li>stay at least 200 feet away from a stage performance taking place.</li>
<li>can't perform during the light show or during special events on the mall, including New Year's Eve activities.</li>
<li>can't bring anything with them bigger than a backpack, unless there are certain items integral to the performance, such as Hula-Hoops or items to juggle.</li>
<li>Amplified sound can only be used if it is part of a performance and only then if the noise level is set at a decibel level that is equal to 70 decibels at the nearest kiosk.</li>
<li>There's also a prohibition against coolers, structures, racks and booths.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was not able to find any explicit provisions for street performers on Las Vegas Blvd. </p>
<hr />
<p>In July 2012 a new ordinance was passed to give police clear guidelines to stop "street peddlers". If you are deemed trying to sell something or accepting money for services in any way you can be detained, arrested, and fined.<sup id="fnref:LVRJ"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:LVRJ" rel="footnote">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:SUN"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SUN" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
<hr />
<p>Casinos and Nightclubs are private property. You can be detained for loitering and trespassing outside the entrance of a casino. There are many reports of this in the last 3 years which brought about the early 2012 law changes about street performance. You can contend the arrest afterwards according citing the first amendment according to several legal cases<sup id="fnref:FIRST"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:FIRST" rel="footnote">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:ACLUNV"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ACLUNV" rel="footnote">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:SUNDETAIN"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SUNDETAIN" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Please be aware that Las Vegas Blvd and all surrounding area's have a different curfew law than the rest of Las Vegas! <strong>If you are 17 years or younger curfew is 9pm (21:00) on Friday, Saturday, and Legal Holidays; 10pm (22:00) on school nights</strong>. A juvenile must be with a parent or with a legal guardian over the age of 21 years. Guardian must have a letter of guardianship upon request. (An older friend is not a guardian)<sup id="fnref:CURFEW"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:CURFEW" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> Yes, the weekend curfew is <em>earlier</em> than the weeknight one.</p>
<hr />
<p>Casino security is instructed to stop anyone on the gaming floor who has anything obstructing their face from the arial and floor security. If you are anywhere near gaming expect to be confronted. The worst that can happen is you are arrested for trespassing<sup id="fnref:OR"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:OR" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> but more than likely you be asked to remove the head or be harassed by security.</p>
<h2>The reality of it</h2>
<p>Ok, enough of the depressing laws. What's the <em>real</em> skinny on suiting in Vegas? Here you go! If you have any recent experiences feel free to email me about it and I may add your experience!</p>
<p>I really would like to add more good places and placed to avoid to this list but I need more <em>verified</em> reports. One bunnies word isn't enough to put a stamp on something.</p>
<h3>Freemont Experience.</h3>
<p>As of February 2012 it is officially legal to fursuit on Freemont! Just be cool and listen to security and you should be fine. No matter what you think, say, or do you are classified as a street performer while in suit so you have to follow their rules which are posted above.. and I will bullet below just because ^_^</p>
<ul>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> attempt to suit during the light show or during special events on the mall, including New Year's Eve activities.</li>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> ask for or accept money from people<sup id="fnref:DONATIONS"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:DONATIONS" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Stay 20 feet away from doors, ATMs, fire lanes and crosswalks</li>
<li>Stay 10 feet away from retail kiosks and outdoor cafes.</li>
<li>Stay at least 200 feet away from a stage performance taking place.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nightclubs and bars</h3>
<p>I've personally seen it be done in more than one event but it involved a group purchasing VIP/bottle service, clearing it with the club owner ahead of time, and using the club's greenroom for changing.</p>
<p>It's easier down in smaller and independent clubs around town since the big ass are part of casinos and have strict dress codes but no matter where you go but expect to pay for the privilege and get everything cleared ahead of time.</p>
<p>Oh… and watch out. It's a dark loud stuffy room full of drunk people.</p>
<h3>On the strip</h3>
<p>You usually can fursuit on the strip without too much problem. Make sure one of your handlers has your ID, just in case.</p>
<p>Please be aware that you will <em>not</em> always be welcome. Many people and some authority do not like street performers on the strip. (<em>See the legal section above for information about current anti-costumer/street performer legislation in the works</em>) For safety's sake you really should <em>stay as far away from the casinos as possible</em>. There are reports of people <em>near</em> the entrance or directly on the property of a casino being harassed, detained, fined, and/or arrested. Whenever possible if you want to avoid problems try to follow the exact same rules as when on Freemont.</p>
<h3>Casinos</h3>
<p>I can't recommend against this enough especially if you are big on preserving the magic. You will be required to verify your identity publicly, possibly more than once.</p>
<p>The short of it is to remember that all casinos are <em>private property</em> and have their own security team. <strong>What you can and cannot do will always be down to their discretion at that time</strong>. If you piss off security enough they have the ability to eject you, ban you from the property, or turn you over to Metro you as a trespasser even if you have chips, a room, a friend, ect; Communicate clearly and be extra nice to them always if you wanna pull this off.</p>
<p>Some casino's have convention space and non gambling areas. These technically should be fair game but some fursuiters have gotten mixed results doing this. In the end remember to have a handler, your ID, and prepare to take you head off to chat it out.</p>
<h2>Stay safe</h2>
<p>Most of all don't forget to stay safe and have fun no matter where you suit in vegas!</p>
